        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <h3>Final Project for Data Visualization that will look into the rise of
        popularity in the Nintendo game title Animal Crossing New Horizons. Specifically the
        traction it's gained throughout the years, the impact of sales, and how the audience
        responds to the many different animals the game has to offer.</h3>

        <h4>Taking data from Google search trends we can see the volume of people's
            search of "Animal Crossing" throughout time. From the visualization we can
            see how the search activity spikes around the same time a new game is launched.
            In comparison to previous games, we can observe the significant spike in search
            trends around the time the New Horizons game was released around March 2020.</h4>

        <h4>Besides an increase in search volume, New Horizons has also shown it's title success
        through its revenue in sales. Looking at how New Horizons compares to other Animal Crossing
        titles, we can see how New Horizons was able to make more than double the sales from New Leaf.</h4>

        <h4>One of the game's charm points lies within the many characters included in the game
        for the player to interact with and live on their island with them. With many available there
        are certain villagers that stand above the rest and it's apparent given the attention they
        acquire from player communities. In this visualization we look at the estimated search volume
        of every villager and which one's are more popular than others.</h4>
