        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <h3>This is the final project for Data Visualization that will look into the rise of
        popularity in the Nintendo game title Animal Crossing New Horizons.
        Specifically it will look into the traction it's gained throughout the years,
        the impact of sales, and how the audience responds to the many different animals the
        game has to offer.</h3>

        <h2>Search Trends:</h2>
        <h4>Taking data from Google search trends we can see the volume of people's
            search of "Animal Crossing" throughout time. From the visualization we can
            see how the search activity spikes around the same time a new game is launched.
            In comparison to previous games, we can observe the significant spike in search
            trends around the time the New Horizons game was released around March 2020.</h4>

        <h2>Sales:</h2>
        <h4>Besides an increase in search volume, New Horizons has also shown it's title success
        through its revenue in sales. Looking at how New Horizons compares to other Animal Crossing
        titles, we can see how New Horizons was able to make more than double the sales from New Leaf.</h4>

        <h2>Character Popularity:</h2>
        <h4>One of the game's charm points lies within the many characters included in the game
        for the player to interact with and live on their island with them. With many available there
        are certain villagers that stand above the rest and it's apparent given the attention they
        acquire from player communities. In this visualization we look at the estimated search volume
        of every villager and to look at which one's are more popular than others. In this instance
        the names of the top 20 villagers with the highest search volume names are on display.</h4>

            species along with their personality</h4>
